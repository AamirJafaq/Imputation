# Imputation
In machine learning, an imputer is a tool or technique used to handle missing data by filling in missing or null values with estimated or computed values. Missing data is common in real-world datasets, and imputation is a way to deal with it in a way that doesn't discard valuable information (as would happen with data removal) or introduce bias.\
Imputation can be done in several ways, depending on the nature of the data and the underlying distribution such as mean/median/mode imputation, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, regression imputation, interpolation and forward/backward fill and many more.
